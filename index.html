        <p>
            To test and see if this webpage looks different in other browsers, we ran our webpage on three different
            browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. The differences between Google Chrome and Microsoft
            Edge are barely visible. Although in Firefox there was one noticeable difference. The message that appears
            when you forget to fill in the form completely has a whole different style compared to the other browsers.
            Each browser has it's own default values for these kind of things.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the webpage is designed to be compatible with hendheld devices, meaning the size of the screen
            will determine layout of the webpage.
            If the screen has a width below 600px the main table will collapse and appear differently, making it much
            more readable on small screens.
