This repository contains all the work done for a basic website and webserver which contains a fully dynamic gallery, intended to display images and descriptions of famous authors.
The webpage is designed to be accessible, and the gallery can be filtered and updated through use of event-driven programming and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The webserver is routed using Express and the data is stored using SQLite.
The dynamic webpage makes use of the Fetch API to communicate with the webserver, which is built under the RESTful API guidelines, and employs full CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) functionality.
