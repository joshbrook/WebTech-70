DOCUMENTION FOR FRONT-END USERS OF this RESTFULL HTTP API

When using a server and a database there are a few thing that are important to know. First of all it is 
important to know what is meant by CRUD. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. CRUD helps the user to 
get, post, update or delete information from the database. Down below you will find a list with an explaination
of each operator, combined with the key REST (Representational State Transfer):

1. CREATE (POST) - The create function allows the user to add new records/information to the database. In this server
if a new record is being posted, the endpoint that is being used is 'http://localhost/..../api/'. This is the location
where the new record can be found. Posting requires the user to send along a body with a new author as paramater. 
This body would look this for example:
{
    "author":  "Jason",
	"alt": "picture of jason",
	"tags": "html",
	"image": "example.jpg",
	"description": "Jason is an author"
}

2. READ (GET) - The read function allows the user to get records/information from the database. To get information
of an existing record in the database a GET request will be usefull. The endpoint that is being used to receive 
information about al the authors in the database is 'http://localhost/..../api'. This will give the user a list of 
al the authors that exist in the data base and it requires no further parameters. 

If the user wants to acces information of only one author the user should use the following endpoint:
'http://localhost/..../api/?id'. The id of the specific author should be given as a paramter.  

3. UPDATE (PUT) - The update function allows the user to make changes to current records/information of the database. 


4. DELETE (DELETE)- The delete function allows the user to delete current records/information completely form the database.
